# On The to Find My Elixir - I Found The Alchemist After Deciding to Focus On Evil
Recently, I started working throug the MEAP [The Little Elixir & Otp Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook) to focus on learning Elixir and get some power skills with the ecosystem.  While this was essentially a tool chain expedition, I need to bootstrap my dev tools.  Recently, due to the awesome, and exuberant encouragement of [Sebastian](https://github.com/sbastn) I became interested in moving off of ``SublimeText` and into `vim`.  With even more exuberance, and encouragement from [Ben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-zenittini-19457563), I am trying [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) as part of the dev tools.  This includes `vim` and a useful version of `emacs`.  Eventually I ended up at the Alchemist and we will get to that soon.
## spacemacs
It is not necessarily enough just [install spacemacs](git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d), I found that on my upgraded `OSX` that I was missing the pretty spalsh screen and so on.  This is because I didn't install `emacs` using the `--with-cocoa` option via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).  In fact, I found by following [their OSX specific instructions on github](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#os-x), I was able to get the things I wanted.  Basically the pretty splash screen and a better `OSX` experience.
## Okay, Now What?
So, if you have been a `windows` based developer for a while, using OSX at home and wanting only one editor for both places you may have learned `emacs` or `vim`.  I never got there, for `OSX` I first stopped at `TextMate` but of course there were only some pale imitations for that on `windows`.  So when `SublimeText` I was excited.  I could have one editor in two places.  However, `SublimeText` isn't free, the developer was on holiday for a while and when I upgraded my `Mavericks` laptop to `The Captain`, `SublimeText` burst into flames in the package manager script.  I had dealt with issues there several times but I was done.  I decided to abandon ship and switch over to `vim`.  I have begun using `vim` for more things.  However, no lie, I missed `SublimeRepl`, because everyone knows `repl === good` and only a fool would want to not have a work flow like save code, run tests and go into console if a test bombs.  `SublimeRepl` with `sbt` running `~ test` is a very effective workflow for developing `Scala` without an `IDE`.  That's not a typo.  No `IDE`.  So, moving to `vim` meant losing the tool chain I knew.  Anyway, I decided to go ahead with `EVIL` and join `spacemacs` users.  

After, installing `spacemacs` you may wonder, how do I get around in it as not just `emacs` and not just `vim` but as `spacemacs`?  Well there are some useful tutorials out there.  To start moving around and doing useful things in `spacemacs` try [Spacemacs Tutorials](https://simpletutorials.com/c/3022/Spacemacs+Tutorials).  It is task based on practical things and easy to use a quick reference. Once you have those fundementals down, you may just need to have the [Spacemacs (VIM Mode) Cheatsheet](https://simpletutorials.com/uploads/30f0ea60-1348-11e6-b660-f23c91df6128/spacemacs_cheatsheet.pdf).  In fact, I am relying on these now as I write this post in `markdown` using `spacemacs`.
## For Mixing Your Elixir You May Want The Alchemist
Finally, we arrive at the reason I went through all of the above.  I am _just starting out with Elixir_ and as part of this process, I want a tool chain that let's me focue on `Elixir` coding.  While I have not tried this out yet - due to focusing on the above items - I think that if you are going to try both `Elixir` and `spacemacs` you should enlist the help of [Alchemist](http://www.zohaib.me/spacemacs-and-alchemist-to-make-elixir-of-immortality/), I am certianly going to give it a try.  I like integration with `repls` and I like flow.
