# On The to Find My Elixir - I Found The Alchemist After Deciding to Focus On Evil
Recently, I started working through the MEAP [The Little Elixir & Otp Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook) to focus on learning Elixir and get some power skills with the ecosystem.  While this was essentially a tool chain expedition, I needed to bootstrap my dev tools.  Recently, due to the awesome, and exuberant encouragement of [Sebastian](https://github.com/sbastn) I became interested in moving off of `SublimeText` and into `vim`.  With even more exuberance, and encouragement from [Ben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-zenittini-19457563), I am trying [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) as part of the dev tools.  This includes `vim` and a useful version of `emacs`.  Eventually I ended up at the Alchemist and we will get to that soon.

## spacemacs
It is not necessarily enough just to [install spacemacs](git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d), I found that on my upgraded `OSX` that I was missing the pretty spalsh screen and so on.  This is because I didn't install `emacs` using the `--with-cocoa` option via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).  In fact, I found by following [their OSX specific instructions on github](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#os-x), I was able to get the things I wanted.  Basically the pretty splash screen and a better `OSX` experience.

## Okay, Now What?
After, installing `spacemacs` you may wonder, "How do I get around in it not just as `emacs` or `vim` but as `spacemacs`?"  Well there are some useful tutorials out there.  To start moving around and doing useful things in `spacemacs` try [Spacemacs Tutorials](https://simpletutorials.com/c/3022/Spacemacs+Tutorials).  It is task based on practical things and easy to use as a quick reference. Once you have those fundamentals down, you may need the [Spacemacs (VIM Mode) Cheatsheet](https://simpletutorials.com/uploads/30f0ea60-1348-11e6-b660-f23c91df6128/spacemacs_cheatsheet.pdf).  In fact, I am relying on these now as I write this. 

## For Mixing Your Elixir You May Want The Alchemist
Finally, we arrive at the reason I went through all of the above.  I am _just starting out with Elixir_ and as part of this process, I want a tool chain that let's me focus on `Elixir` coding.  While I have not tried out [Alchemist](http://www.zohaib.me/spacemacs-and-alchemist-to-make-elixir-of-immortality/) yet, I have a feeling it will be what I am looking for.  I like integration with `repls` and I like flow.
